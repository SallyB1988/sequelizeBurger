# Zippy's Burger Shop - Sequelized
This is the same app as Zippy's Burger Shop, but now it uses Sequelize instead of a handwritten ORM.
This is the fastest burger shop around! To 'eat' at Zippy's, just go to: [https://zippys-burgers.herokuapp.com/]

## Place an Order
On the left side of the screen, enter your name and select the type of burger, bun and cheese -- then hit the `Place Order` button. You will hear the chef hit the 'order up' bell and your order will appear in the `Served Burgers` column. **Zippy's likes to live up to their name!**

## Eat Your Burger
Click on the `Eat` button on the ticket of the burger you would like to consume. You will see a quick image of someone enjoying the burger, and then the ticket will be moved to the 'Consumed Burgers' column.

## Code Details
